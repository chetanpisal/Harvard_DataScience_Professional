## The tidyverseonce we start more advanced analyses, the preferred unit for data storage is not the vector but the data frame. In this chapter we learn to work directly with data frames, which greatly facilitate the organization of information. We will be using data framesfor the majority of this book. We will focus on a specific data format referred to as tidy andon specific collection of packages that are particularly helpful for working with tidy data referred to as the tidyverse.We can load all the tidyverse packages at once by installing and loading the tidyverse**package:**_library(tidyverse)_We will learn how to implement the tidyverse approach throughout the book, but beforedelving into the details, in this chapter we introduce some of the most widely used tidyverse functionality, starting with the dplyr package for manipulating data frames and the purrr package for working with functions. Note that the tidyverse also includes a graphing package, ggplot2, which we introduce later in Chapter 7 in the Data Visualization part of the book; the readr package discussed in Chapter 5; and many others. In this chapter, we first introduce the concept of tidy data and then demonstrate how we use the tidyverse to work with data frames in this format.
